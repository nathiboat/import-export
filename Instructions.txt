For each of the steps below, please provide the code created and the files produced clearly marked as Step1 and Step 2.
Do not forget to include any instructions for us to run the work you produce.

We are expecting to see well named classes, observing DRY and KISS principles.

We do NOT want you to submit a framework application, so please do not submit your working as a Laravel/Lumen/Symfony/etc application.

Please do not rush to complete the work, we are more interested in correctly functioning/structured code that is incomplete rather than rushed and poorly crafted code.

Technical Test
==============
1. Craft some code that will export the following columns from the enclosed CSV files into a single JSON array of objects
    a. Genres, just using id and name, as genres.json
    b. Keywords, just using id and name, as keywords.json
    c. Actors, just using id and name, as actors.json

    Be aware that the data format of those columns is JSON and will need to be decoded. Each element in the resultant file should only appear in the file once.

2. Create a single file, movies.json, that contains an array of JSON objects for each movie, containing
    a. the title,
    b. budget,
    c. a list of ids of keywords for the movie
    d. a list of ids of genres for the movie
    e. an array of 'character' objects that provides (only) the character name and associated actor_id for each character
